    "description": "Face Masks like this Agbogho Mmuo or “maiden spirit” are made by the Igbo people of southern Nigeria. Although this mask type varies in shape and color, the masks consistently feature an elaborate hairstyle extending far above the mask’s face. The white portions of the mask likely allude to the spiritual nature of the figure as well as to embodying purity. Agbogo Mmuo masks that celebrate ideal female beauty and femininity are among the most celebrated masquerade types for the Igbo people. This ideal female beauty, albeit exaggerated in both the portrayal and the movement, is represented in the thin, straight nose, small mouth, small ears, small build, and elaborate, highly stylized hairstyles adorned with crests and wooden combs, The Mmuo masks represent the spirit of a female ancestor but are worn by men only who imitate the graceful gestures and movement of women while music plays, and others sing. They pay tribute to the girls of the past and the present. The Agbogo Mmuo is danced during the dry season for agricultural rituals and during funerals for prominent members of the masking society. They also emphasize traditional values."

    "description": "This Helmet mask comes from the Kuba People in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Kuba are in fact comprised of a federation of 18 chiefdoms. These chiefdoms are unified under the Bushong king, who first solidified power in the seventeenth-century. The Kuba people reached their height in the nineteenth century. This mask is likely an example of one of three royal masks used in masquerades and other ceremonies, such as initiation rites and funerals, especially of titled elders (though some say they are not used in funerals). Called a Bwoom mask, the Lowe’s example has the typical elements of recognizable facial features, a copper plate, cowrie shells, and other forms of beading. The red beads here symbolize power and standing. Like other Kuba objects, the mask is typified by its elaborate materials and patterning. Aesthetic considerations and beauty in crafting were important and widely held cultural values. Indeed, it has been said that the Kuba “never leave a surface undecorated.” During a masquerade, Bwoom mask wearers are completely covered by their costumes, which can be composed of fabric, cowrie shells, beadwork feathers, raffia, and even leather and seed pods to give it a “spiritual” look. Beadwork is used to highlight facial features such as the eyes and the lips. The Bwoom costumes are not as refined as the other costumes in the masquerade to represent Bwoom’s status as a common man.\n\n\n Three royal masks are used in masquerades to illustrate the stories of the kingdom’s origin.  All three are considered to embody nature spirits (mingesh). The first mask, the Mwashamboy, is the highest in rank and represents Woot, the first Kuba king. Bwoom, the second is said to be a commoner and half-brother of Woot and is said to represent the common people. In the ceremony, Bwoom defies Mwashamboy (by challenging his right to the throne and by to competing with him for the love of the third, female spirit, Ngaady a Mwash.\n"
